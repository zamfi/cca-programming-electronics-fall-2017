### Homework 10 (due Monday, November 13, 2017)

Prepare for next week's in-class quiz, on Wednesday, November 15. As a reminder, here are the rules and expectations for the quiz:

- Open-notes -- bring whatever notes you wish, including the practice quiz! Printed-out notes are fine.
- No electronic devices allowed -- no mobile phones, no laptops, no tables, no kindles, no Arduinos -- in short, nothing electronic and nothing that can run code (except your brain!)

But first, write a proposal for your final project and [send it to me](mailto:jzamfirescupereira@cca.edu) by Monday, November 13.

#### Final Project

Prepare a proposal for your final project.

Create a new github repository for your project, and modify the README.md file to include your project proposal. To learn about formatting text in markdown `.md` files, read [this tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) and look at the [project proposal template](project-template.md).

I've also created a [sample project proposal](sample-proposal.md) for your perusal.

Your proposal should be thoughtful, complete, and should take into consideration the feedback you received from me and your classmates. You can always modify what you're doing later on, but your proposal should describe a complete project.

The final project is your opportunity to put to work what you've learned so far in class, and to build the skills you're most interested in taking forward with you into your career. *Each assignment is in the project sequence is required, so put in the time to ensure that each is complete and well-considered!*
